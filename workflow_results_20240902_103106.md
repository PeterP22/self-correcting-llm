## Initial Query
```
Read a text file and return the count of each word
```

## Attempts
### Attempt 1/2
#### Generated Function
```python

```

#### Test Case
```python

```

#### Example Usage
```python

    """
    Reads a text file and returns a dictionary with the count of each word.
    
    :param filename: str - The path to the text file
    :return: dict - A dictionary where keys are words and values are their counts
