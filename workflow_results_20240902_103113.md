# Self-Correcting LLM Coding Workflow Results

## Initial Query
```
Design a simple class to represent a bank account with deposit and withdraw methods
```

## Attempts
### Attempt 1/2
#### Generated Function
```python

```

#### Test Case
```python

```

#### Example Usage
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0.0):
        """Initialize a new bank account instance."""
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        """Deposit money into the bank account."""
        if amount <= 0:
            print("Deposit amount must be positive.")
            return
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited {amount}, new balance is {self.balance}.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        """Withdraw money from the bank account."""
        if amount <= 0:
            print("Withdraw amount must be positive.")
            return
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds.")
            return
        self.balance -= amount
        print(f"Withdrew {amount}, new balance is {self.balance}.")

    def __str__(self):
        """Return the string representation of the bank account."""
        return f"BankAccount(owner={self.owner}, balance={self.balance})"

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a bank account for John Doe with an initial balance of $100
    account = BankAccount("John Doe", 100.0)

    # Deposit $50
    account.deposit(50)
    # Withdraw $30
    account.withdraw(30)
    # Try to withdraw more than the available balance
    account.withdraw(150)

    # Print the state of the account
    print(account)

# Test Case
def test_bank_account():
    account = BankAccount("Jane Doe", 200.0)

    # Test deposit
    account.deposit(100)
    assert account.balance == 300.0

    # Test withdraw
    account.withdraw(50)
    assert account.balance == 250.0

    # Test insufficient funds
    account.withdraw(300)
    assert account.balance == 250.0

    print("All test cases passed.")

# Run the test case
test_bank_account()
```
